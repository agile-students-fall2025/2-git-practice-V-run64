[Towards Minimalist Game Design](https://www.nealen.net/papers/tmgd.pdf)

From reading this paper on **Minimal Game Design**, I have learned quite a bit about the topic. In short, minimal game design strips a game down to its core through heavily constrained mechanics. This creates a more focused gameplay experience while keeping controls simple and accessible. Controls and mechanics are usually limited to very few inputs, but the real depth comes from the constraints themselves—such as obstacle speed, player speed, time limits, or the need for precise maneuvers—rather than from adding more mechanics. Visual design in minimalist games often relies on simple, abstract shapes, while sound design tends to emphasize feedback, with effects tied directly to player actions or game events.
